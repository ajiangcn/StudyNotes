## Consensus

Mining - proposal
new block inlcude the hash of previous block
add nonce to create a block with hash starting with 0000

forks - different miner find the valid solution - longest chain wins

dynamically adjust the hash difficulity (depends on the nodes participate in the networks) to control interval a new block is generated.

coinbase - start with 50 BTC and halves every 210,000 blocks (roughly 3-4 years), currently 12.5 BTC
